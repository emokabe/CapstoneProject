# Emily's Capstone Project

## Description

This iOS app is a course collaboration tool where students can interact with each other's posts about course-related topics. Many of my core features will revolve around the Facebook SDK.

To log into my app, the user will need to first log into their Facebook account or sign up for a new Facebook account to log in with through OAuth. Upon login, the user will see a feed of posts for the current course that the user is viewing. Each course is represented by a Facebook group, and all posts posted on the app are posted in the corresponding Facebook group.
The user is also able to switch between viewing different courses on their app, and the course that they had been viewing during their last session will be stored in a backend database so that they can come back to it when logging in again.
Finally, the user is able to compose a post in the selected course. Composing a post will cause a new post to pop up on the feed, and will also cause the post to be posted on the corresponding Facebook group as mentioned before.
